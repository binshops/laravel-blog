### Lightweight and Comprehensive

Incredible features with a lightweight laravel blog package. I highly recommend it because:
- Quick installation (<3 minutes)
- It's very easy to extend
- Included great features out-of-box
- Its simplicity allows to be easily made compatible with latest laravel
- No additional concept except laravel knowledge
- Compatible with other Laravel platforms like Bagisto

## Outstanding Features
- Fulltext Search - search throughout all blog posts
- Multi Level Category - nested sets using Baum
- Multi Language Support 

### Quick and easy installation (Multi-lang version)
1- Install via composer

`composer require binshops/laravel-blog`

For a fresh Laravel installation run the following too:

```
composer require laravel/ui
php artisan ui vue --auth
```

2- Run the following two commands to copy config file, migration files, and view files

`php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BinshopsBlog\BinshopsBlogServiceProvider"`

3- Execute migrations to create tables

`php artisan migrate;`

4- You must add one method to your \App\User (in laravel 8 \App\Models\User) model. As the name of this method shows it determines which user can manage posts. Place your logic there

```
 /**
     * Enter your own logic (e.g. if ($this->id === 1) to
     *   enable this user to be able to add/edit blog posts
     *
     * @return bool - true = they can edit / manage blog posts,
     *        false = they have no access to the blog admin panel
     */
    public function canManageBinshopsBlogPosts()
    {
        // Enter the logic needed for your app.
        // Maybe you can just hardcode in a user id that you
        //   know is always an admin ID?

        if (       $this->id === 1
             && $this->email === "your_admin_user@your_site.com"
           ){

           // return true so this user CAN edit/post/delete
           // blog posts (and post any HTML/JS)

           return true;
        }

        // otherwise return false, so they have no access
        // to the admin panel (but can still view posts)

        return false;
    }
```

5- Create a directory in `public/` named `blog_images`

6- Login as admin and setup your package: `/blog_admin/setup`

Congrats! Your blog is ready to use. (URLs are customizable in the config file)
  
  Admin panel URI: `/blog_admin`
  Front URI: `/en/blog`

### Single Language Version
To install the single language version of the package use version v8.1x:

1- `composer require binshops/laravel-blog:v8.1.2`

2- `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BinshopsBlog\BinshopsBlogServiceProvider"`

3- `php artisan vendor:publish --tag=laravel-fulltext`

4- `php artisan migrate;`

You can see the single version in "single-lang" branch.

## What/who this package is for:

 - For websites running Laravel
 - Who wants to have a site blog. This laravel blog gives an easy to use interface to write blog posts/assign categories/manage existing posts
 - Where only admin users can edit/manage the blog (this is not suitable for every user on your site to be able to manage posts)
 - For anyone who likes to add a wordpress-like laravel blog to laravel website

## How to customise the blog views/templates

After doing the correct `vendor:publish`, all of the default template files will be found in /resources/views/vendor/binshopsblog/ and are easy to edit to match your needs.

### Customizing admin views
If you need to customize the admin view, just copy the files from
`vendor/binshopsblog/src/Views/binshopsblog_admin`
to
`resources/views/vendor/binshopsblog_admin`
Then you can modify them just like any other view file.

## Language switcher:
You can add a language switcher to rhe menu of your application. Add something like in yout app.blade.php:
``
<li class="nav-item dropdown">
  <a id="navbarDropdown" class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" role="button"
    data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false" v-pre>
    {{ App::getLocale() }}
    <b class="caret"></b>
  </a>
  <div class="dropdown-menu dropdown-menu-right" aria-labelledby="navbarDropdown">
    @foreach(BinshopsBlog\Models\BinshopsLanguage::all() as $language)
      <a class="dropdown-item" href="{{ route('language', [$language->locale]) }}">
        {{ $language->locale }}
      </a>
    @endforeach
  </div>
</li>``
## Routes

It will auto set all required routes (both public facing, and admin backend). There are some config options (such as changing the /blog/ url to something else), which can be done in the binshopsblog.php file.

## Config options
All config options have comments which describe what they do. Please just refer to the `binshopsblog.php` file in your /config/ dir.

### Custom User Model
You can change the default user model through the config file.

## Events

You can find all the events that are fired by looking in the `/src/Events` directory.

Add these (and an Event Listener) to your `EventServiceProvider.php` file to make use of these events when they fire.

## Built in CAPTCHA / anti spam

There is a built in captcha (anti spam comment) system built in, which will be easy for you to replace with your own implementation.

  Please see [this Captcha docs](https://binshops.binshops.com/laravel-blog-package#captcha) for  more details.

## Image upload errors

Try adding this to config/app.php:

    'Image' => Intervention\Image\Facades\Image::class

- Also make sure that /tmp is writable. If you have open_basedir enabled, be sure to add :/tmp to its value.
- Ensure that /public/blog_images (or whatever directory you set it to in the config) is writable by the server
- You might need to set a higher memory limit, or upload smaller image files. This will depend on your server. I've used it to upload huge (10mb+) jpg images without problem, once the server was set up correctly to handle larger file uploads.
